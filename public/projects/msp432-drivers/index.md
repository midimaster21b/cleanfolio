# Ti MSP432 Driver Library

[Source Code](https://github.com/midimaster21b/MSP432_DriverLibrary)


Throughout my years in undergraduate school we consistently used the Ti MSP432 development board.
In order to ease it's continual use, I decided to develop a driver library that could be included or referenced
for future projects. This helped accelerate my ability to deliver for school projects as well as introduced me
to peripherals I wouldn't end up using in school.
