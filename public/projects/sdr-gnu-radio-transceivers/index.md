# GNU Radio Transceivers

## Overview

For this paper several different transceivers were developed and tested using GNU Radio Companion.
The transceivers developed included analog transceivers (AM, FM) and digital transceivers (4-fsk, bpsk, and QAM).
The purpose of this project was to develop proof-of-concept transceivers that could be used in a lab setting
to easily introduce undergraduate or graduate students to the concepts and architectures of transceivers behind
common modern communication techniques.

Some of the blocks necessary for implementation of these transceivers were not readily available and had to be
developed. For this paper, I was responsible for designing and developing the digital transceivers. This process included
identifying any missing blocks and developing them to achieve working implementations of the previsouly mentioned digital
communication methods included in this paper.
